# python-technical-screen

This repo houses a basic Python technical screen for a data engineer role. The screen is designed to test basic data manipulation using skills using `pandas`, and puts an emphasis on evaluating how a candidate approaches a problem. Solutions are available upon request.

## Setup

__Note:__ You can edit the template as much as you like - just make sure you update the `requirements.txt` if you add any extra dependencies

1. Fork or clone this repo to your personal github. Make any changes to the files that you want.
2. Go to the [binder](https://mybinder.org/) website and fill in the `github url` field. Fill in `python-technical-screen.ipynb` for the `Path to a notebook file` field for binder to link directly to the notebook.
3. Press `launch` and copy the binder url that is generated. 

Going to the binder url will build a docker image containing the contents of the repo with packages `requirements.txt` pip installed. Post-build you will be redirected to an interactive Jupyter instance.
